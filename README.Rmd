This package performs regression analysis to investigate the impact of covariates on the time-dependent AUC under competing risks, based on the manuscript "Accounting for Competing Risks in the Assessment of Prognostic Biomarkersâ€™ Discriminative Accuracy".


## Installation

You can install the development version of tAUCCR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


``` {r eval = F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xinran-h/tAUCCR")
```

## tAUCCR in a nutshell
This package has three functions, data_crossingdc, covariance_cal, and auc_pred.

### Function: data_crossingdc
The function data_crossingdc is used to reshape data for each cause of failure so that the result reshaped data is ready for parameter estimation. The arguments of this function are listed below:

- `n`   Total sample size
- `vt`  Vector of observed time
- `vc` Vector of censoring indicator
- `vm` vector of biomarker values
- `vxs` Covariate matrix
- `eta` Censoring indicator for each event type
- `c0` A constant value used for the bandwidth h, h = c0*n^(-1/3)
- `cont_vars` A vector of continuous variables in vxs.
- `discrete_vars` A vector of discrete variables in vxs.

This function returns a dataframe where each row corresponds to a case-control pair at each observed event time. The dataframe has the following components:

- `i`: Index for cases
- `yi`: Observed event time
- Covariates with "i" suffix: Covariate columns, with names based on the original covariate name and an "i" suffix for case values
- `l`: Index for controls
- `Iil`: Indicator for comparison of baseline biomarker values (1 if case biomarker > control biomarker, 0 otherwise)
- `dif`: Euclidean norm among continuous covariates, when available
- `rho01` and `rho02`: Numeric vectors representing concordant and discordant event values, respectively, when continuous covariates are present
- `rhoweight`: Kernel weight vector, calculated with continuous covariates

### Function: covariance_cal_wrapper
The function `covariance_cal_wrapper` is a wrapper function that calls the c++ function covariance_cal, which computes three matrices: \(\Sigma_1\), \(\Sigma_2\), and \(V\). The asymptotic variance, \(V\), is defined as:

\[
V = \Sigma_1^{-1} \Sigma_2 \Sigma_1^{-1}
\]

The arguments of this function are listed below:

- `a`: A vector of regression coefficients
- `b`: A vector of biomarker values
- `c`: The `rho01` vector from the dataframe returned by the `data_crossingdc` function. When there are no continuous variables, use the `Iil` vector from the dataframe returned by the `data_crossingdc` function
- `d`: The `rho02` vector from the dataframe returned by the `data_crossingdc` function. When there are no continuous variables, use the `1 - Iil` vector from the dataframe returned by the `data_crossingdc` function
- `e`: A transposed matrix where each row represents a covariate, including an intercept as the first row. The rows are ordered to correspond with the regression coefficients in `a`
- `f`: The `i - 1` vector from the dataframe returned by the `data_crossingdc` function
- `g`: The `l - 1` vector from the dataframe returned by the `data_crossingdc` function

This function returns a list containing:

- `sigma1`: The matrix \(\Sigma_1\), used in calculating the asymptotic variance
- `sigma2`: The matrix \(\Sigma_2\), also used in calculating the asymptotic variance
- `v`: The asymptotic variance \(V\)

### Function: auc_pred
The function auc_pred is to estimate the the time-dependent AUC with confidence interval for each cause of failure. The arguments of this function are listed below:

- `beta.hat`   Estimated regression coefficients
- `V`  The asymptotic variance returned from the function covariance_cal
- `t0` A vector of time
- `cov.val` A vector where each element represents a covariate value, ordered to correspond to the elements in \code{beta.hat} for each covariate
- `nf` A numeric value of 3 or 7 for the number of polynomials. When `nf = 7`, the vector of polynomials is $\text{c}(t^{-2}, t^{-1}, t^{-0.5}, \log(t), t^{0.5}, t, t^2)$. When `nf = 3`, the vector of polynomials is $\text{c}(\log(t), t, t^2)$

This function returns a matrix of confidence intervals for the time-dependent AUC for each cause of failure.


## An example

We use a demo data to illustrate how to use this package. The demo data can be loaded by the following code.
```{r, eval = F}
library(tAUCCR)
dd = tAUCCR::demo
```

This data is a dataframe of 400 rows and 5 columns: `Y`, `delta`, `xd`, `xc`, and `M`. The columns are defined as follows:

- `Y` Observed event time
- `delta` Censoring indicator, 0 = censored, 1 = event 1, 2 = event 2
- `xd` A binary covariate with values of 0 and 1
- `xc` A continuous covariate
- `M` Baseline biomarker values

To analyze the impact of covariates on the time-dependent AUC under competing risks, we apply the following regression model for each of the event $k$, k = 1,2:

\[
     \eta\{AUC(t;\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)})\} = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{J} \alpha_{j}^{(k)}t^{(p_j)} + \mathbf{x}^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(k)}
\]

The goal is to estimate the regression coefficients \(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{(k)}\)  for each event type, and make inference on these regression coefficients.

The first step is to reshape the data using the function `data_crossingdc`. The following code reshapes the data and stores the result in the data frame `dd_crossed1` for event 1 and `dd_crossed2` for event 2. We use a c0 of 2 here as an example.

```{r, eval = F}

# obtain the arguments from the demo data
n = nrow(dd)
Y0 = dd$Y
C0 = dd$delta
M0 = dd$M
VXS = dd[,c("xd","xc")]
c0 = 2
cont_vars = c("xc")
discrete_vars = c("xd")

dd_crossed1 = data_crossingdc(n, Y0,C0,M0,VXS,1,2, cont_vars, discrete_vars)
dd_crossed2 = data_crossingdc(n, Y0,C0,M0,VXS,2,2, cont_vars, discrete_vars)
```

The next step is to estimate the regression coefficients for each event type. Here we show the code for the first event. We use the `fastglm` package to estimate the regression coefficients. The estimated coefficients are stored in the vector `beta.hat`.

```{r, eval = F}

# install if not installed
# install.packages("fastglm")
library(fastglm)
covariates_i <- paste0(c("xd", "xc"), "i")
YI = dd_crossed1$yi
    
XS<- as.matrix(cbind(int = 1,
                         t1 = YI^(-2),
                         t2 = YI^(-1),
                         t3 = YI^(-0.5),
                         t4 = log(YI),
                         t5 = YI^(0.5),
                         t6 = YI,
                         t7 = YI^(2),
                         dd_crossed1[covariates_i]))
YS<-dd_crossed1$Iil
rho01<-dd_crossed1$rho01
rho02<-dd_crossed1$rho02
rhoweight<-dd_crossed1$rhoweight
ordic=dd_crossed1$i-1
ordjc=dd_crossed1$l-1
gc() 
outcome <- fastglm(XS,YS,weights = rhoweight,family=binomial(link="logit"),maxit=10000L) 
beta.hat = outcome$coefficients
```

The next step is to calculate the asymptotic variance of the estimated regression coefficients. The following code calculates the asymptotic variance and stores the result in the variable `V`.

```{r, eval = F}

L=covariance_cal_wrapper(beta.hat,M0,rho01,rho02,t(XS),ordic,ordjc)
V = L$v    
```

The Wald statistic and p-value, using the large sample SE, are obtained using the following code:
```{r, eval = F}
SE = sqrt(diag(V[[1]]))
z_value <- beta.hat/ SE
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_value)))
```

You can also estimate the time-dependent AUC with confidence interval for each cause of failure. The following code estimates the time-dependent AUC for cause 1, given xc = 1 and xd = 0 at time t0 ranges from 0.1 to 1:

```{r, eval = F}
t0 <- seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1)
cov.val = c(1,0)
ci <- auc_pred(beta.hat,V,t0,cov.val,  nf=7)
```
